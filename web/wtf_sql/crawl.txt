It is a period of civil war.
Rebel hackers, striking
from a hidden base, have won
their first victory against
the evil DBA.

During the battle, Rebel
spies managed to steal secret
plans to the DBA's
ultimate weapon, WTF.SQL,
an integrated framework
with enough buzzwords to
host an entire website.

Pursued by the DBA's
sinister agents, You, the
Player, race home aboard
your VT100, custodian of the
stolen schema that can save
the animals and restore
freedom to the internet.....

Your mission is to read out
the txt table in the flag
database.

Enjoy :>
